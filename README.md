## Task Manager

Uses the MVC design pattern to implement CRUD actions to create a Task Manager app. 

Completed based on the Task Manager Rails Tutorial (first introduction to a Rails app) from the Turing Backend program's open courseware.

Use rails s to launch a local server. "/" route takes you to the main screen where you can access the Task Index and create a New Task. Other CRUD options are available from those two pages.
